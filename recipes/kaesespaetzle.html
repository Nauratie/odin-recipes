  <h2>Rich and tasty</h2>

  <p><em>Swabian noodles</em> are a great base for any <strong>rich dish</strong>. Prepare them with cheese or with <em>creamy mushroom sauce</em> and your guests will be very pleased</p>
  <p>If you struggle with overweight, Spaetzle, how Swabian Noodles are called in Germany, are probably not the best meal for you since they do not contain any <em>whole-grain</em> and are often prepared with a lot of fat. However, if you need a filling and lasting meal, they are a good option and nothing tastes better than <em>Kaesespaetzle</em> after a long day of hiking.</p>
